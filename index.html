          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined.
          I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

          "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some 
          people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found incredibly fun! I enrolled 
          shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully 
          switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

          Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance

          Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!

            "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed 
            some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a 
            former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not 
            disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long fot assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was 
            outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often reffered to it during interviews 
            as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
